TEST FILE - SAME TEXT AS the_method_en.txt on the_method folder OR OUTDATED

"the method" is an exploit for IMTLazarus for Chromebook that occurs thanks to the folder that it creates on your bookmarks ([name of your school w/ no caps and altogether])

to replicate it:
1. locate your folder
2. delete it
3. wait until Lazarus creates it again
4. delete again and as soon as posible after doing so, restart with Reload Page+Power
5. as soon as possible, press Esc+Reload Page+Power to enter Recovery Mode
6. close/Shut down your Chromebook and turn it on again
7. when logged in, press Alt+[1 to 9] on your keyboard to open Chrome manually
8. try to go to a (normally) blocked page
9. enjoy! (if everything was done correctly)

- how did you find this?
tinkering around.

- can a teacher see me while in this state? what does this do?
not really, as this exploit kills the IMTLazarus process on login for the account on which the process was done

- I've rebooted my Chromebook and it's back, what happened?
oh, yea, this only lasts until you restart/shut down your Chromebook

- I've tried various times but it doesn't work, what do I do?
there are various variants on how to enable this. They will be added as separate files when I discover and try them out to document the process.
