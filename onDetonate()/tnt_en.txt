want to hide ALL traces of you using exploits such as "the method" whilst having a few minutes of freedom after still? then follow these steps:

(Note: THIS EXPLOIT IS REALLY NOT WORTH USING, and even if you want to do it, backup anything important. This only works for Chromebooks)
1. Ensure your syncronization options indicate that your search history WON'T be synced
2. Log out and DELETE your account
3. Register yourself as a user again and, as soon as possible, disable your Wi-Fi connection, but ensuring IMTLazarus' been installed.
4. Log out and in back again

If everything goes as expected, now you have a few minutes where IMTLazarus will fetch your information during a larger while and in the meanwhile, do anything you want.
