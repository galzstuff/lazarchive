- NOTE: IT IS UNKNOWN IF THIS WORKS FOR OTHER IMTLAZARUS VERSIONS, BUT WHEN THIS BUG OCCURED FOR ME I WAS USING THE CHROMEBOOK VERSION.
i, at the time of making this entry, had stumbled accross a bug when i recently started a new school year. 
it seemed that IMTLazarus had, for some reason(?) given up on me and stopped indicating that i was in a school and that i was managed by IMTLazarus overall.

this made it so:
- i could visit any site (except chrome:// sites that IMTLazarus ALWAYS blocked no matter what)
- teachers could not see me on IMTLazarus or control anything related to me at all
- i still had a tab limit, sadly, as IMTLazarus' runtime wasn't killed, it just failed to fetch necessary information(?).
- when LITERALLY resetting the Chromebook through Recovery Mode, on login, the bug would persist to happen

it did get fixed FOR ME after FORCEFULLY restarting my profile, as a teacher asked why they were not able to see me on the panel, and i said "oh, it most probably bugged, you know?" (and i got my profile reset and therefor all my data erased the next day)

how to do this:
i don't know. it happened to me randomly, so i guess it's up to you to try and do this, but if i find a way i'll log it in here.
