bug named "RNGLazarus" (by me :3) is a bug that can happen on login (or at any time at all) on a Chromebook with this extension installed, similar to "the method" exploit, where everything is unlocked (presumably because the IMTLazarus background worker/runtime died).

how to do this bug:
- the name is literally RNGLazarus. it's luck based, what did you expect?
- LET'S GO FUCKING GAMBLING BABY!!!!
